      "description": "Rocketr is a cloud-synced, social note-taking application available across web and mobile platforms.\r\n\r\nIn the same way you would use your moleskine, or the default notepad on your phone, using Rocketr is equally as simple. Take a note, then take another. Notes don't need titles, tags, or formatting. We believe that the value of each individual note is so small, that there should be nothing between you and writing it down.\r\n\r\nTogether though - notes make up our thoughts, our ideas, and eventually - dictate our actions. This is where Rocketr shines.\r\n\r\nUsers have the option of assigning their notes (at the moment they're taken, or later) to a notebook. Each notebook, in turn, has a series of editors - people you've invited to write in that notebook with you. Every time you place a note in that notebook, your editors can see it, add comments to it, and upvote it. And you can do the same for their notes too.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a note to a notebook, you open the conversation. You give that note a chance to become an idea. Your notebooks are like a pulse for your ideas and you can have as many notebooks as you like - all of them with different editors. Notebooks can be private to you and your editors, or, if you wish to see the ideas travel, you can make your notebook public for all the world to see and follow.",
