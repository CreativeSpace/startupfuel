We let you sell things right from your phone in one simple step, and leverage cutting-edge technology to help you get your stuff sold as fast and painlessly as possible.  Seriously.  We're so confident in what we're building that we'll guarantee that you won't find a better way to sell things anywhere.\r\n\r\n### What are We Doing Now?\r\n\r\nWe're currently hard at work building out our core systems and nearing private beta.\r\n\r\n### Why Do We Need Money?\r\n\r\nWell, we're working our collective asses off to secure some funding, but we're almost certainly not going to close by the end of June.  Unfortunately, we need to pay rent, and eat, and maybe buy a phone or two so that we can do better testing.\r\n\r\nIf we can raise 5k, we'll be able to go full blast on Hipsell for the month of June, continue to nail our milestones, and be fully on track for a public beta in month of July.\r\n\r\nYour support would be awesome, and we'll put any and all money we raise towards making Hipsell the best application you can get for your phone (or web browser).\r\n",

      "description": "<h3>At The Highest Level</h3>\r\n\r\nRocketr is a cloud-synced, social note-taking application available across web and mobile platforms.\r\n\r\n<h3>What's Rocketr For?</h3>\r\n\r\nIn the same way you would use your moleskine, or the default notepad on your phone, using Rocketr is equally as simple. Take a note, then take another. Notes don't need titles, tags, or formatting. We believe that the value of each individual note is so small, that there should be nothing between you and writing it down.\r\n\r\nTogether though - notes make up our thoughts, our ideas, and eventually - dictate our actions. This is where Rocketr shines.\r\n\r\nUsers have the option of assigning their notes (at the moment they're taken, or later) to a notebook. Each notebook, in turn, has a series of editors - people you've invited to write in that notebook with you. Every time you place a note in that notebook, your editors can see it, add comments to it, and upvote it. And you can do the same for their notes too.\r\n\r\nWhen you add a note to a notebook, you open the conversation. You give that note a chance to become an idea. Your notebooks are like a pulse for your ideas and you can have as many notebooks as you like - all of them with different editors. Notebooks can be private to you and your editors, or, if you wish to see the ideas travel, you can make your notebook public for all the world to see and follow.\r\n\r\n<h3>What's The Money For? </h3>\r\n\r\nWe want to build a super dope Chrome extension. It's going to be the best bookmarking plug-in since Delicious (we suspect). We also need to keep our operations rolling day-to-day. We're a team of 5 people and any remaining funds beyond the Chrome extension will go towards getting Zach (our Data Architect) a new pair of shoes. If you saw what he's wearing, you'd understand. Also, Jen (our CTO) hasn't eaten since Thursday. Evan (our Designer) has to maintain his hipster image... and well, I promised the StartupFuel team we'd drink some beer together.",
